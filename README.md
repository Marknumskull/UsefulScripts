# Useful Scripts

This repo is a set of small scripts I have put together that I use on a daily basis to help automate my workload or that I have otherwise found handy.

I plan on adding more as I create them, feel free to download and use as you please.

The scripts are found in the _scripts_ folder with each script having its own folder. This contains the script, a readme.md and any other files that may be required.
